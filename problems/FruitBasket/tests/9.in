pride and prejudiceby jane austenchapter 1it is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man inpossession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.however little known the feelings or views of such a man maybe on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so wellfixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is consideredthe rightful property of some one or other of their daughters."my dear mr. bennet," said his lady to him one day, "have youheard that netherfield park is let at last?"mr. bennet replied that he had not."but it is," returned she; "for mrs. long has just been here, andshe told me all about it."mr. bennet made no answer."do you not want to know who has taken it?" cried his wifeimpatiently."you want to tell me, and i have no objection to hearing it."this was invitation enough."why, my dear, you must know, mrs. long says that netherfieldis taken by a young man of large fortune from the north ofengland; that he came down on monday in a chaise and four tosee the place, and was so much delighted with it, that he agreedwith mr. morris immediately; that he is to take possessionbefore michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in thehouse by the end of next week.""what is his name?""bingley.""is he married or single?""oh! single, my dear, to be sure! a single man of largefortune; four or five thousand a year. what a fine thing for ourgirls!""how so? how can it affect them?""my dear mr. bennet," replied his wife, "how can you be sotiresome! you must know that i am thinking of his marryingone of them.""is that his design in settling here?""design! nonsense, how can you talk so! but it is very likelythat he may fall in love with one of them, and therefore youmust visit him as soon as he comes.""i see no occasion for that. you and the girls may go, or youmay send them by themselves, which perhaps will be stillbetter, for as you are as handsome as any of them, mr. bingleymay like you the best of the party.""my dear, you flatter me. i certainly have had my share ofbeauty, but i do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now.when a woman has five grown-up daughters, she ought to giveover thinking of her own beauty.""in such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of.""but, my dear, you must indeed go and see mr. bingley whenhe comes into the neighbourhood.""it is more than i engage for, i assure you.""but consider your daughters. only think what an establishmentit would be for one of them. sir william and lady lucas aredetermined to go, merely on that account, for in general, youknow, they visit no newcomers. indeed you must go, for it willbe impossible for us to visit him if you do not.""you are over-scrupulous, surely. i dare say mr. bingley willbe very glad to see you; and i will send a few lines by you toassure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever hechooses of the girls; though i must throw in a good word formy little lizzy.""i desire you will do no such thing. lizzy is not a bit betterthan the others; and i am sure she is not half so handsome asjane, nor half so good-humoured as lydia. but you are alwaysgiving her the preference.""they have none of them much to recommend them," replied he;"they are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but lizzyhas something more of quickness than her sisters.""mr. bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such away? you take delight in vexing me. you have no compassionfor my poor nerves.""you mistake me, my dear. i have a high respect for yournerves. they are my old friends. i have heard you mentionthem with consideration these last twenty years at least."mr. bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour,reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three-and-twentyyears had been insufficient to make his wife understand hischaracter. her mind was less difficult to develop. she was awoman of mean understanding, little information, and uncertaintemper. when she was discontented, she fancied herself nervous.the business of her life was to get her daughters married; itssolace was visiting and news.chapter 2mr. bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on mr.bingley. he had always intended to visit him, though to the lastalways assuring his wife that he should not go; and till theevening after the visit was paid she had no knowledge of it.it was then disclosed in the following manner. observing hissecond daughter employed in trimming a hat, he suddenlyaddressed her with:"i hope mr. bingley will like it, lizzy.""we are not in a way to know what mr. bingley likes," saidher mother resentfully, "since we are not to visit.""but you forget, mamma," said elizabeth, "that we shall meethim at the assemblies, and that mrs. long promised to introducehim.""i do not believe mrs. long will do any such thing. she has twonieces of her own. she is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and ihave no opinion of her.""no more have i," said mr. bennet; "and i am glad to find thatyou do not depend on her serving you."mrs. bennet deigned not to make any reply, but, unable tocontain herself, began scolding one of her daughters."don't keep coughing so, kitty, for heaven's sake! have a littlecompassion on my nerves. you tear them to pieces.""kitty has no discretion in her coughs," said her father; "shetimes them ill.""i do not cough for my own amusement," replied kitty fretfully."when is your next ball to be, lizzy?""to-morrow fortnight.""aye, so it is," cried her mother, "and mrs. long does not comeback till the day before; so it will be impossible for her tointroduce him, for she will not know him herself.""then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, andintroduce mr. bingley to her.""impossible, mr. bennet, impossible, when i am not acquaintedwith him myself; how can you be so teasing?""i honour your circumspection. a fortnight's acquaintance iscertainly very little. one cannot know what a man really is bythe end of a fortnight. but if we do not venture somebody elsewill; and after all, mrs. long and her daughters must stand theirchance; and, therefore, as she will think it an act of kindness,if you decline the office, i will take it on myself."the girls stared at their father. mrs. bennet said only,"nonsense, nonsense!""what can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?" criedhe. "do you consider the forms of introduction, and the stressthat is laid on them, as nonsense? i cannot quite agree withyou there. what say you, mary? for you are a young lady ofdeep reflection, i know, and read great books and make extracts."mary wished to say something sensible, but knew not how."while mary is adjusting her ideas," he continued, "let us returnto mr. bingley.""i am sick of mr. bingley," cried his wife."i am sorry to hear that; but why did not you tell me thatbefore? if i had known as much this morning i certainly wouldnot have called on him. it is very unlucky; but as i haveactually paid the visit, we cannot escape the acquaintance now."the astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished; that ofmrs. bennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though, when the firsttumult of joy was over, she began to declare that it was what shehad expected all the while."how good it was in you, my dear mr. bennet! but i knew i shouldpersuade you at last. i was sure you loved your girls too wellto neglect such an acquaintance. well, how pleased i am! and itis such a good joke, too, that you should have gone this morningand never said a word about it till now.""now, kitty, you may cough as much as you choose," said mr.bennet; and, as he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with theraptures of his wife."what an excellent father you have, girls!" said she, when thedoor was shut. "i do not know how you will ever make himamends for his kindness; or me, either, for that matter. at ourtime of life it is not so pleasant, i can tell you, to be makingnew acquaintances every day; but for your sakes, we would doanything. lydia, my love, though you are the youngest, i daresay mr. bingley will dance with you at the next ball.""oh!" said lydia stoutly, "i am not afraid; for though i am theyoungest, i'm the tallest."the rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon hewould return mr. bennet's visit, and determining when theyshould ask him to dinner.chapter 3not all that mrs. bennet, however, with the assistance of herfive daughters, could ask on the subject, was sufficient to drawfrom her husband any satisfactory description of mr. bingley.they attacked him in various ways--with barefaced questions,ingenious suppositions, and distant surmises; but he eluded theskill of them all, and they were at last obliged to accept thesecond-hand intelligence of their neighbour, lady lucas. herreport was highly favourable. sir william had been delightedwith him. he was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremelyagreeable, and, to crown the whole, he meant to be at the nextassembly with a large party. nothing could be more delightful!to be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love;and very lively hopes of mr. bingley's heart were entertained."if i can but see one of my daughters happily settled atnetherfield," said mrs. bennet to her husband, "and all theothers equally well married, i shall have nothing to wish for."in a few days mr. bingley returned mr. bennet's visit, and satabout ten minutes with him in his library. he had entertainedhopes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies, ofwhose beauty he had heard much; but he saw only the father.the ladies were somewhat more fortunate, for they had theadvantage of ascertaining from an upper window that he worea blue coat, and rode a black horse.an invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched; andalready had mrs. bennet planned the courses that were to docredit to her housekeeping, when an answer arrived whichdeferred it all. mr. bingley was obliged to be in town thefollowing day, and, consequently, unable to accept the honourof their invitation, etc. mrs. bennet was quite disconcerted.she could not imagine what business he could have in town sosoon after his arrival in hertfordshire; and she began to fearthat he might be always flying about from one place to another,and never settled at netherfield as he ought to be. lady lucasquieted her fears a little by starting the idea of his being goneto london only to get a large party for the ball; and a reportsoon followed that mr. bingley was to bring twelve ladies andseven gentlemen with him to the assembly. the girls grievedover such a number of ladies, but were comforted the daybefore the ball by hearing, that instead of twelve he broughtonly six with him from london--his five sisters and a cousin.and when the party entered the assembly room it consisted ofonly five altogether--mr. bingley, his two sisters, the husbandof the eldest, and another young man.mr. bingley was good-looking and gentlemanlike; he had a pleasantcountenance, and easy, unaffected manners. his sisters were finewomen, with an air of decided fashion. his brother-in-law, mr.hurst, merely looked the gentleman; but his friend mr. darcy soondrew the attention of the room by his fine, tall person, handsomefeatures, noble mien, and the report which was in generalcirculation within five minutes after his entrance, of his havingten thousand a year. the gentlemen pronounced him to be a finefigure of a man, the ladies declared he was much handsomer thanmr. bingley, and he was looked at with great admiration for abouthalf the evening, till his manners gave a disgust which turnedthe tide of his popularity; for he was discovered to be proud;to be above his company, and above being pleased; and not all hislarge estate in derbyshire could then save him from having a mostforbidding, disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to becompared with his friend.mr. bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all theprincipal people in the room; he was lively and unreserved,danced every dance, was angry that the ball closed so early,and talked of giving one himself at netherfield. such amiablequalities must speak for themselves. what a contrast betweenhim and his friend! mr. darcy danced only once with mrs. hurstand once with miss bingley, declined being introduced to anyother lady, and spent the rest of the evening in walking aboutthe room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party. hischaracter was decided. he was the proudest, most disagreeableman in the world, and everybody hoped that he would never comethere again. amongst the most violent against him was mrs.bennet, whose dislike of his general behaviour was sharpenedinto particular resentment by his having slighted one of herdaughters.elizabeth bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen,to sit down for two dances; and during part of that time,mr. darcy had been standing near enough for her to hear aconversation between him and mr. bingley, who came from thedance for a few minutes, to press his friend to join it."come, darcy," said he, "i must have you dance. i hate to seeyou standing about by yourself in this stupid manner. you hadmuch better dance.""i certainly shall not. you know how i detest it, unless i amparticularly acquainted with my partner. at such an assembly asthis it would be insupportable. your sisters are engaged, andthere is not another woman in the room whom it would not be apunishment to me to stand up with.""i would not be so fastidious as you are," cried mr. bingley,"for a kingdom! upon my honour, i never met with so manypleasant girls in my life as i have this evening; and there areseveral of them you see uncommonly pretty.""you are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room,"said mr. darcy, looking at the eldest miss bennet."oh! she is the most beautiful creature i ever beheld! butthere is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you, who isvery pretty, and i dare say very agreeable. do let me ask mypartner to introduce you.""which do you mean?" and turning round he looked for amoment at elizabeth, till catching her eye, he withdrew his ownand coldly said: "she is tolerable, but not handsome enough totempt me; i am in no humour at present to give consequenceto young ladies who are slighted by other men. you had betterreturn to your partner and enjoy her smiles, for you are wastingyour time with me."mr. bingley followed his advice. mr. darcy walked off; andelizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings toward him.she told the story, however, with great spirit among her friends;for she had a lively, playful disposition, which delighted inanything ridiculous.the evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the wholefamily. mrs. bennet had seen her eldest daughter muchadmired by the netherfield party. mr. bingley had danced withher twice, and she had been distinguished by his sisters. janewas as much gratified by this as her mother could be, though ina quieter way. elizabeth felt jane's pleasure. mary had heardherself mentioned to miss bingley as the most accomplishedgirl in the neighbourhood; and catherine and lydia had beenfortunate enough never to be without partners, which was allthat they had yet learnt to care for at a ball. they returned,therefore, in good spirits to longbourn, the village where theylived, and of which they were the principal inhabitants. theyfound mr. bennet still up. with a book he was regardless oftime; and on the present occasion he had a good deal ofcuriosity as to the events of an evening which had raised suchsplendid expectations. he had rather hoped that his wife'sviews on the stranger would be disappointed; but he soonfound out that he had a different story to hear."oh! my dear mr. bennet," as she entered the room, "we havehad a most delightful evening, a most excellent ball. i wish youhad been there. jane was so admired, nothing could be like it.everybody said how well she looked; and mr. bingley thoughther quite beautiful, and danced with her twice! only think ofthat, my dear; he actually danced with her twice! and she wasthe only creature in the room that he asked a second time.first of all, he asked miss lucas. i was so vexed to see himstand up with her! but, however, he did not admire her at all;indeed, nobody can, you know; and he seemed quite struck withjane as she was going down the dance. so he inquired who shewas, and got introduced, and asked her for the two next. thenthe two third he danced with miss king, and the two fourth withmaria lucas, and the two fifth with jane again, and the twosixth with lizzy, and the boulanger--""if he had had any compassion for me," cried her husbandimpatiently, "he would not have danced half so much! for god'ssake, say no more of his partners. o that he had sprainedhis ankle in the first place!""oh! my dear, i am quite delighted with him. he is soexcessively handsome! and his sisters are charming women.i never in my life saw anything more elegant than their dresses.i dare say the lace upon mrs. hurst's gown--"here she was interrupted again. mr. bennet protested againstany description of finery. she was therefore obliged to seekanother branch of the subject, and related, with much bitternessof spirit and some exaggeration, the shocking rudeness of mr.darcy."but i can assure you," she added, "that lizzy does not losemuch by not suiting his fancy; for he is a most disagreeable,horrid man, not at all worth pleasing. so high and so conceitedthat there was no enduring him! he walked here, and he walkedthere, fancying himself so very great! not handsome enough todance with! i wish you had been there, my dear, to have givenhim one of your set-downs. i quite detest the man."chapter 4when jane and elizabeth were alone, the former, who had beencautious in her praise of mr. bingley before, expressed to hersister just how very much she admired him."he is just what a young man ought to be," said she, "sensible,good-humoured, lively; and i never saw such happy manners!--somuch ease, with such perfect good breeding!""he is also handsome," replied elizabeth, "which a young manought likewise to be, if he possibly can. his character is therebycomplete.""i was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a secondtime. i did not expect such a compliment.""did not you? i did for you. but that is one great differencebetween us. compliments always take you by surprise, andme never. what could be more natural than his asking youagain? he could not help seeing that you were about five timesas pretty as every other woman in the room. no thanks to hisgallantry for that. well, he certainly is very agreeable, and igive you leave to like him. you have liked many a stupiderperson.""dear lizzy!""oh! you are a great deal too apt, you know, to like people ingeneral. you never see a fault in anybody. all the world aregood and agreeable in your eyes. i never heard you speak ill ofa human being in your life.""i would not wish to be hasty in censuring anyone; but i alwaysspeak what i think.""i know you do; and it is that which makes the wonder. with yourgood sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsenseof others! affectation of candour is common enough--one meetswith it everywhere. but to be candid without ostentation ordesign--to take the good of everybody's character and make itstill better, and say nothing of the bad--belongs to you alone.and so you like this man's sisters, too, do you? their mannersare not equal to his.""certainly not--at first. but they are very pleasing women whenyou converse with them. miss bingley is to live with herbrother, and keep his house; and i am much mistaken if we shallnot find a very charming neighbour in her."elizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced; theirbehaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please ingeneral; and with more quickness of observation and less pliancyof temper than her sister, and with a judgement too unassailed byany attention to herself, she was very little disposed to approvethem. they were in fact very fine ladies; not deficient in goodhumour when they were pleased, nor in the power of makingthemselves agreeable when they chose it, but proud andconceited. they were rather handsome, had been educated inone of the first private seminaries in town, had a fortune oftwenty thousand pounds, were in the habit of spending morethan they ought, and of associating with people of rank, andwere therefore in every respect entitled to think well ofthemselves, and meanly of others. they were of a respectablefamily in the north of england; a circumstance more deeplyimpressed on their memories than that their brother's fortuneand their own had been acquired by trade.mr. bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly ahundred thousand pounds from his father, who had intended topurchase an estate, but did not live to do it. mr. bingleyintended it likewise, and sometimes made choice of his county;but as he was now provided with a good house and the liberty ofa manor, it was doubtful to many of those who best knew theeasiness of his temper, whether he might not spend theremainder of his days at netherfield, and leave the nextgeneration to purchase.his sisters were anxious for his having an estate of his own; but,though he was now only established as a tenant, miss bingleywas by no means unwilling to preside at his table--nor was mrs.hurst, who had married a man of more fashion than fortune, lessdisposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her.mr. bingley had not been of age two years, when he was temptedby an accidental recommendation to look at netherfield house.he did look at it, and into it for half-an-hour--was pleased withthe situation and the principal rooms, satisfied with what theowner said in its praise, and took it immediately.between him and darcy there was a very steady friendship, inspite of great opposition of character. bingley was endeared todarcy by the easiness, openness, and ductility of his temper,though no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own,and though with his own he never appeared dissatisfied. on thestrength of darcy's regard, bingley had the firmest reliance, andof his judgement the highest opinion. in understanding, darcywas the superior. bingley was by no means deficient, but darcywas clever. he was at the same time haughty, reserved, andfastidious, and his manners, though well-bred, were not inviting.in that respect his friend had greatly the advantage. bingley wassure of being liked wherever he appeared, darcy was continuallygiving offense.the manner in which they spoke of the meryton assembly wassufficiently characteristic. bingley had never met with morepleasant people or prettier girls in his life; everybody had beenmost kind and attentive to him; there had been no formality, nostiffness; he had soon felt acquainted with all the room; and, asto miss bennet, he could not conceive an angel more beautiful.darcy, on the contrary, had seen a collection of people in whomthere was little beauty and no fashion, for none of whom he hadfelt the smallest interest, and from none received either attentionor pleasure. miss bennet he acknowledged to be pretty, but shesmiled too much.mrs. hurst and her sister allowed it to be so--but still theyadmired her and liked her, and pronounced her to be a sweetgirl, and one whom they would not object to know more of.miss bennet was therefore established as a sweet girl, and theirbrother felt authorized by such commendation to think of her ashe chose.chapter 5within a short walk of longbourn lived a family with whomthe bennets were particularly intimate. sir william lucashad been formerly in trade in meryton, where he had made atolerable fortune, and risen to the honour of knighthood by anaddress to the king during his mayoralty. the distinction hadperhaps been felt too strongly. it had given him a disgustto his business, and to his residence in a small market town;and, in quitting them both, he had removed with his familyto a house about a mile from meryton, denominated from thatperiod lucas lodge, where he could think with pleasure of hisown importance, and, unshackled by business, occupy himselfsolely in being civil to all the world. for, though elated by hisrank, it did not render him supercilious; on the contrary, he wasall attention to everybody. by nature inoffensive, friendly, andobliging, his presentation at st. james's had made him courteous.lady lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever tobe a valuable neighbour to mrs. bennet. they had severalchildren. the eldest of them, a sensible, intelligent youngwoman, about twenty-seven, was elizabeth's intimate friend.that the miss lucases and the miss bennets should meet totalk over a ball was absolutely necessary; and the morning afterthe assembly brought the former to longbourn to hear and tocommunicate."you began the evening well, charlotte," said mrs. bennet withcivil self-command to miss lucas. "you were mr. bingley'sfirst choice.""yes; but he seemed to like his second better.""oh! you mean jane, i suppose, because he danced with hertwice. to be sure that did seem as if he admired her--indeedi rather believe he did--i heard something about it--but ihardly know what--something about mr. robinson.""perhaps you mean what i overheard between him and mr. robinson;did not i mention it to you? mr. robinson's asking him how heliked our meryton assemblies, and whether he did not think therewere a great many pretty women in the room, and which he thoughtthe prettiest? and his answering immediately to the lastquestion: 'oh! the eldest miss bennet, beyond a doubt; therecannot be two opinions on that point.'""upon my word! well, that is very decided indeed--that doesseem as if--but, however, it may all come to nothing, you know.""my overhearings were more to the purpose than yours, eliza,"said charlotte. "mr. darcy is not so well worth listening toas his friend, is he?--poor eliza!--to be only just tolerable.""i beg you would not put it into lizzy's head to be vexed byhis ill-treatment, for he is such a disagreeable man, that itwould be quite a misfortune to be liked by him. mrs. longtold me last night that he sat close to her for half-an-hourwithout once opening his lips.""are you quite sure, ma'am?--is not there a little mistake?"said jane. "i certainly saw mr. darcy speaking to her.""aye--because she asked him at last how he liked netherfield,and he could not help answering her; but she said he seemedquite angry at being spoke to.""miss bingley told me," said jane, "that he never speaks much,unless among his intimate acquaintances. with them he isremarkably agreeable.""i do not believe a word of it, my dear. if he had been so veryagreeable, he would have talked to mrs. long. but i can guesshow it was; everybody says that he is eat up with pride, and idare say he had heard somehow that mrs. long does not keepa carriage, and had come to the ball in a hack chaise.""i do not mind his not talking to mrs. long," said miss lucas,"but i wish he had danced with eliza.""another time, lizzy," said her mother, "i would not dancewith him, if i were you.""i believe, ma'am, i may safely promise you never to dancewith him.""his pride," said miss lucas, "does not offend me so much aspride often does, because there is an excuse for it. one cannotwonder that so very fine a young man, with family, fortune,everything in his favour, should think highly of himself. if imay so express it, he has a right to be proud.""that is very true," replied elizabeth, "and i could easilyforgive his pride, if he had not mortified mine.""pride," observed mary, who piqued herself upon the solidityof her reflections, "is a very common failing, i believe. byall that i have ever read, i am convinced that it is very commonindeed; that human nature is particularly prone to it, andthat there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling ofself-complacency on the score of some quality or other, realor imaginary. vanity and pride are different things, thoughthe words are often used synonymously. a person may be proudwithout being vain. pride relates more to our opinion ofourselves, vanity to what we would have others think of us.""if i were as rich as mr. darcy," cried a young lucas, whocame with his sisters, "i should not care how proud i was. iwould keep a pack of foxhounds, and drink a bottle of wine aday.""then you would drink a great deal more than you ought," saidmrs. bennet; "and if i were to see you at it, i should take awayyour bottle directly."the boy protested that she should not; she continued to declarethat she would, and the argument ended only with the visit.chapter 6the ladies of longbourn soon waited on those of netherfield.the visit was soon returned in due form. miss bennet'spleasing manners grew on the goodwill of mrs. hurst and missbingley; and though the mother was found to be intolerable,and the younger sisters not worth speaking to, a wish ofbeing better acquainted with them was expressed towardsthe two eldest. by jane, this attention was received with thegreatest pleasure, but elizabeth still saw superciliousness intheir treatment of everybody, hardly excepting even her sister,and could not like them; though their kindness to jane, such as itwas, had a value as arising in all probability from the influenceof their brother's admiration. it was generally evidentwhenever they met, that he did admire her and to her it wasequally evident that jane was yielding to the preference whichshe had begun to entertain for him from the first, and was in away to be very much in love; but she considered with pleasurethat it was not likely to be discovered by the world in general,since jane united, with great strength of feeling, a composureof temper and a uniform cheerfulness of manner which wouldguard her from the suspicions of the impertinent. shementioned this to her friend miss lucas."it may perhaps be pleasant," replied charlotte, "to be able toimpose on the public in such a case; but it is sometimes adisadvantage to be so very guarded. if a woman conceals heraffection with the same skill from the object of it, she may losethe opportunity of fixing him; and it will then be but poorconsolation to believe the world equally in the dark. there isso much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment, thatit is not safe to leave any to itself. we can all begin freely--aslight preference is natural enough; but there are very few of uswho have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement.in nine cases out of ten a women had better show more affectionthan she feels. bingley likes your sister undoubtedly; but hemay never do more than like her, if she does not help him on.""but she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow.if i can perceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton,indeed, not to discover it too.""remember, eliza, that he does not know jane's disposition asyou do.""but if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavour toconceal it, he must find it out.""perhaps he must, if he sees enough of her. but, thoughbingley and jane meet tolerably often, it is never for manyhours together; and, as they always see each other in largemixed parties, it is impossible that every moment should beemployed in conversing together. jane should therefore makethe most of every half-hour in which she can command hisattention. when she is secure of him, there will be more leisurefor falling in love as much as she chooses.""your plan is a good one," replied elizabeth, "where nothing isin question but the desire of being well married, and if i weredetermined to get a rich husband, or any husband, i dare say ishould adopt it. but these are not jane's feelings; she is notacting by design. as yet, she cannot even be certain of thedegree of her own regard nor of its reasonableness. she hasknown him only a fortnight. she danced four dances with himat meryton; she saw him one morning at his own house, andhas since dined with him in company four times. this is notquite enough to make her understand his character.""not as you represent it. had she merely dined with him, shemight only have discovered whether he had a good appetite; butyou must remember that four evenings have also been spenttogether--and four evenings may do a great deal.""yes; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain thatthey both like vingt-un better than commerce; but with respectto any other leading characteristic, i do not imagine that muchhas been unfolded.""well," said charlotte, "i wish jane success with all my heart;and if she were married to him to-morrow, i should think shehad as good a chance of happiness as if she were to be studyinghis character for a twelvemonth. happiness in marriage isentirely a matter of chance. if the dispositions of the partiesare ever so well known to each other or ever so similar beforehand,it does not advance their felicity in the least. they alwayscontinue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have theirshare of vexation; and it is better to know as little as possibleof the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life.""you make me laugh, charlotte; but it is not sound. you knowit is not sound, and that you would never act in this wayyourself."occupied in observing mr. bingley's attentions to her sister,elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becomingan object of some interest in the eyes of his friend. mr. darcyhad at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty; he had looked ather without admiration at the ball; and when they next met, helooked at her only to criticise. but no sooner had he made itclear to himself and his friends that she hardly had a good featurein her face, than he began to find it was rendered uncommonlyintelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes. to thisdiscovery succeeded some others equally mortifying. though hehad detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfectsymmetry in her form, he was forced to acknowledge her figureto be light and pleasing; and in spite of his asserting that hermanners were not those of the fashionable world, he was caughtby their easy playfulness. of this she was perfectly unaware;to her he was only the man who made himself agreeable nowhere,and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance with.he began to wish to know more of her, and as a step towardsconversing with her himself, attended to her conversation withothers. his doing so drew her notice. it was at sir williamlucas's, where a large party were assembled."what does mr. darcy mean," said she to charlotte, "bylistening to my conversation with colonel forster?""that is a question which mr. darcy only can answer.""but if he does it any more i shall certainly let him know that isee what he is about. he has a very satirical eye, and if i do notbegin by being impertinent myself, i shall soon grow afraid ofhim."on his approaching them soon afterwards, though withoutseeming to have any intention of speaking, miss lucas defiedher friend to mention such a subject to him; which immediatelyprovoking elizabeth to do it, she turned to him and said:"did you not think, mr. darcy, that i expressed myselfuncommonly well just now, when i was teasing colonel forsterto give us a ball at meryton?""with great energy; but it is always a subject which makes a ladyenergetic.""you are severe on us.""it will be her turn soon to be teased," said miss lucas. "iam going to open the instrument, eliza, and you know whatfollows.""you are a very strange creature by way of a friend!--alwayswanting me to play and sing before anybody and everybody!if my vanity had taken a musical turn, you would have beeninvaluable; but as it is, i would really rather not sit downbefore those who must be in the habit of hearing the very bestperformers." on miss lucas's persevering, however, she added,"very well, if it must be so, it must." and gravely glancing atmr. darcy, "there is a fine old saying, which everybody here is ofcourse familiar with: 'keep your breath to cool your porridge';and i shall keep mine to swell my song."her performance was pleasing, though by no means capital.after a song or two, and before she could reply to the entreatiesof several that she would sing again, she was eagerly succeededat the instrument by her sister mary, who having, in consequenceof being the only plain one in the family, worked hard forknowledge and accomplishments, was always impatient fordisplay.mary had neither genius nor taste; and though vanity had givenher application, it had given her likewise a pedantic air andconceited manner, which would have injured a higher degree ofexcellence than she had reached. elizabeth, easy and unaffected,had been listened to with much more pleasure, though notplaying half so well; and mary, at the end of a long concerto,was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by scotch and irishairs, at the request of her younger sisters, who, with some of thelucases, and two or three officers, joined eagerly in dancing atone end of the room.mr. darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a modeof passing the evening, to the exclusion of all conversation, andwas too much engrossed by his thoughts to perceive that sirwilliam lucas was his neighbour, till sir william thus began:"what a charming amusement for young people this is, mr. darcy!there is nothing like dancing after all. i consider it as oneof the first refinements of polished society.""certainly, sir; and it has the advantage also of being in vogueamongst the less polished societies of the world. every savagecan dance."sir william only smiled. "your friend performs delightfully," hecontinued after a pause, on seeing bingley join the group; "and idoubt not that you are an adept in the science yourself, mr.darcy.""you saw me dance at meryton, i believe, sir.""yes, indeed, and received no inconsiderable pleasure from thesight. do you often dance at st. james's?""never, sir.""do you not think it would be a proper compliment to theplace?""it is a compliment which i never pay to any place if i canavoid it.""you have a house in town, i conclude?"mr. darcy bowed."i had once had some thought of fixing in town myself--for i amfond of superior society; but i did not feel quite certain that theair of london would agree with lady lucas."he paused in hopes of an answer; but his companion was notdisposed to make any; and elizabeth at that instant movingtowards them, he was struck with the action of doing a verygallant thing, and called out to her:"my dear miss eliza, why are you not dancing? mr. darcy, youmust allow me to present this young lady to you as a verydesirable partner. you cannot refuse to dance, i am sure whenso much beauty is before you." and, taking her hand, he wouldhave given it to mr. darcy who, though extremely surprised,was not unwilling to receive it, when she instantly drew back,and said with some discomposure to sir william:"indeed, sir, i have not the least intention of dancing. i entreatyou not to suppose that i moved this way in order to beg for apartner."mr. darcy, with grave propriety, requested to be allowed thehonour of her hand, but in vain. elizabeth was determined; nordid sir william at all shake her purpose by his attempt atpersuasion."you excel so much in the dance, miss eliza, that it is cruel todeny me the happiness of seeing you; and though this gentlemandislikes the amusement in general, he can have no objection, iam sure, to oblige us for one half-hour.""mr. darcy is all politeness," said elizabeth, smiling."he is, indeed; but, considering the inducement, my dear misseliza, we cannot wonder at his complaisance--for who wouldobject to such a partner?"elizabeth looked archly, and turned away. her resistance hadnot injured her with the gentleman, and he was thinking of herwith some complacency, when thus accosted by miss bingley:"i can guess the subject of your reverie.""i should imagine not.""you are considering how insupportable it would be to pass manyevenings in this manner--in such society; and indeed i am quiteof your opinion. i was never more annoyed! the insipidity, andyet the noise--the nothingness, and yet the self-importance of allthose people! what would i give to hear your strictures on them!""you conjecture is totally wrong, i assure you. my mind wasmore agreeably engaged. i have been meditating on the verygreat pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a prettywoman can bestow."miss bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face, and desiredhe would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring suchreflections. mr. darcy replied with great intrepidity:"miss elizabeth bennet.""miss elizabeth bennet!" repeated miss bingley. "i am allastonishment. how long has she been such a favourite?--andpray, when am i to wish you joy?""that is exactly the question which i expected you to ask. alady's imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration tolove, from love to matrimony, in a moment. i knew you wouldbe wishing me joy.""nay, if you are serious about it, i shall consider the matter isabsolutely settled. you will be having a charming mother-in-law,indeed; and, of course, she will always be at pemberley with you."he listened to her with perfect indifference while she chose toentertain herself in this manner; and as his composure convincedher that all was safe, her wit flowed long.chapter 7mr. bennet's property consisted almost entirely in an estate oftwo thousand a year, which, unfortunately for his daughters, wasentailed, in default of heirs male, on a distant relation; and theirmother's fortune, though ample for her situation in life, couldbut ill supply the deficiency of his. her father had been anattorney in meryton, and had left her four thousand pounds.she had a sister married to a mr. phillips, who had been a clerkto their father and succeeded him in the business, and a brothersettled in london in a respectable line of trade.the village of longbourn was only one mile from meryton; amost convenient distance for the young ladies, who were usuallytempted thither three or four times a week, to pay their duty totheir aunt and to a milliner's shop just over the way. the twoyoungest of the family, catherine and lydia, were particularlyfrequent in these attentions; their minds were more vacant thantheir sisters', and when nothing better offered, a walk tomeryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours andfurnish conversation for the evening; and however bare of newsthe country in general might be, they always contrived to learnsome from their aunt. at present, indeed, they were wellsupplied both with news and happiness by the recent arrival ofa militia regiment in the neighbourhood; it was to remain thewhole winter, and meryton was the headquarters.their visits to mrs. phillips were now productive of the mostinteresting intelligence. every day added something to theirknowledge of the officers' names and connections. theirlodgings were not long a secret, and at length they began toknow the officers themselves. mr. phillips visited them all, andthis opened to his nieces a store of felicity unknown before.they could talk of nothing but officers; and mr. bingley's largefortune, the mention of which gave animation to their mother,was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals ofan ensign.after listening one morning to their effusions on this subject, mr.bennet coolly observed:"from all that i can collect by your manner of talking, you mustbe two of the silliest girls in the country. i have suspected itsome time, but i am now convinced."catherine was disconcerted, and made no answer; but lydia,with perfect indifference, continued to express her admiration ofcaptain carter, and her hope of seeing him in the course of theday, as he was going the next morning to london."i am astonished, my dear," said mrs. bennet, "that you shouldbe so ready to think your own children silly. if i wished to thinkslightingly of anybody's children, it should not be of my own,however.""if my children are silly, i must hope to be always sensible of it.""yes--but as it happens, they are all of them very clever.""this is the only point, i flatter myself, on which we do notagree. i had hoped that our sentiments coincided in everyparticular, but i must so far differ from you as to think our twoyoungest daughters uncommonly foolish.""my dear mr. bennet, you must not expect such girls to havethe sense of their father and mother. when they get to our age, idare say they will not think about officers any more than we do.i remember the time when i liked a red coat myself very well--and,indeed, so i do still at my heart; and if a smart young colonel,with five or six thousand a year, should want one of my girls ishall not say nay to him; and i thought colonel forster lookedvery becoming the other night at sir william's in his regimentals.""mamma," cried lydia, "my aunt says that colonel forster andcaptain carter do not go so often to miss watson's as they didwhen they first came; she sees them now very often standing inclarke's library."mrs. bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of thefootman with a note for miss bennet; it came from netherfield,and the servant waited for an answer. mrs. bennet's eyessparkled with pleasure, and she was eagerly calling out, whileher daughter read,"well, jane, who is it from? what is it about? what does hesay? well, jane, make haste and tell us; make haste, my love.""it is from miss bingley," said jane, and then read it aloud."my dear friend,--"if you are not so compassionate as to dine to-day with louisaand me, we shall be in danger of hating each other for the restof our lives, for a whole day's tete-a-tete between two womencan never end without a quarrel. come as soon as you can onreceipt of this. my brother and the gentlemen are to dine withthe officers.--yours ever,"caroline bingley""with the officers!" cried lydia. "i wonder my aunt did not tellus of that.""dining out," said mrs. bennet, "that is very unlucky.""can i have the carriage?" said jane."no, my dear, you had better go on horseback, because it seemslikely to rain; and then you must stay all night.""that would be a good scheme," said elizabeth, "if you weresure that they would not offer to send her home.""oh! but the gentlemen will have mr. bingley's chaise to go tomeryton, and the hursts have no horses to theirs.""i had much rather go in the coach.""but, my dear, your father cannot spare the horses, i am sure.they are wanted in the farm, mr. bennet, are they not?""they are wanted in the farm much oftener than i can get them.""but if you have got them to-day," said elizabeth, "my mother'spurpose will be answered."she did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment thatthe horses were engaged. jane was therefore obliged to go onhorseback, and her mother attended her to the door with manycheerful prognostics of a bad day. her hopes were answered;jane had not been gone long before it rained hard. her sisterswere uneasy for her, but her mother was delighted. the raincontinued the whole evening without intermission; jane certainlycould not come back."this was a lucky idea of mine, indeed!" said mrs. bennet morethan once, as if the credit of making it rain were all her own. tillthe next morning, however, she was not aware of all the felicityof her contrivance. breakfast was scarcely over when a servantfrom netherfield brought the following note for elizabeth:"my dearest lizzy,--"i find myself very unwell this morning, which, i suppose, is tobe imputed to my getting wet through yesterday. my kind friendswill not hear of my returning till i am better. they insist alsoon my seeing mr. jones--therefore do not be alarmed if you shouldhear of his having been to me--and, excepting a sore throat andheadache, there is not much the matter with me.--yours, etc.""well, my dear," said mr. bennet, when elizabeth had read thenote aloud, "if your daughter should have a dangerous fit ofillness--if she should die, it would be a comfort to know that itwas all in pursuit of mr. bingley, and under your orders.""oh! i am not afraid of her dying. people do not die of littletrifling colds. she will be taken good care of. as long as shestays there, it is all very well. i would go an see her if i couldhave the carriage."elizabeth, feeling really anxious, was determined to go to her,though the carriage was not to be had; and as she was nohorsewoman, walking was her only alternative. she declared herresolution."how can you be so silly," cried her mother, "as to think of sucha thing, in all this dirt! you will not be fit to be seen when youget there.""i shall be very fit to see jane--which is all i want.""is this a hint to me, lizzy," said her father, "to send forthe horses?""no, indeed, i do not wish to avoid the walk. the distance isnothing when one has a motive; only three miles. i shall be backby dinner.""i admire the activity of your benevolence," observed mary, "butevery impulse of feeling should be guided by reason; and, in myopinion, exertion should always be in proportion to what isrequired.""we will go as far as meryton with you," said catherine andlydia. elizabeth accepted their company, and the three youngladies set off together."if we make haste," said lydia, as they walked along, "perhapswe may see something of captain carter before he goes."in meryton they parted; the two youngest repaired to the lodgings ofone of the officers' wives, and elizabeth continued her walk alone,crossing field after field at a quick pace, jumping over stilesand springing over puddles with impatient activity, and findingherself at last within view of the house, with weary ankles, dirtystockings, and a face glowing with the warmth of exercise.she was shown into the breakfast-parlour, where all but janewere assembled, and where her appearance created a great dealof surprise. that she should have walked three miles so earlyin the day, in such dirty weather, and by herself, was almostincredible to mrs. hurst and miss bingley; and elizabeth wasconvinced that they held her in contempt for it. she wasreceived, however, very politely by them; and in their brother'smanners there was something better than politeness; there wasgood humour and kindness. mr. darcy said very little, and mr.hurst nothing at all. the former was divided between admirationof the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion,and doubt as to the occasion's justifying her coming so faralone. the latter was thinking only of his breakfast.her inquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered.miss bennet had slept ill, and though up, was very feverish, andnot well enough to leave her room. elizabeth was glad to betaken to her immediately; and jane, who had only been withheldby the fear of giving alarm or inconvenience from expressing inher note how much she longed for such a visit, was delighted ather entrance. she was not equal, however, to much conversation,and when miss bingley left them together, could attempt littlebesides expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindnessshe was treated with. elizabeth silently attended her.when breakfast was over they were joined by the sisters; andelizabeth began to like them herself, when she saw how muchaffection and solicitude they showed for jane. the apothecarycame, and having examined his patient, said, as might besupposed, that she had caught a violent cold, and that they mustendeavour to get the better of it; advised her to return to bed,and promised her some draughts. the advice was followedreadily, for the feverish symptoms increased, and her head achedacutely. elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment; nor werethe other ladies often absent; the gentlemen being out, they had,in fact, nothing to do elsewhere.when the clock struck three, elizabeth felt that she must go, andvery unwillingly said so. miss bingley offered her the carriage,and she only wanted a little pressing to accept it, when janetestified such concern in parting with her, that miss bingley wasobliged to convert the offer of the chaise to an invitation toremain at netherfield for the present. elizabeth most thankfullyconsented, and a servant was dispatched to longbourn toacquaint the family with her stay and bring back a supply ofclothes.chapter 8at five o'clock the two ladies retired to dress, and at half-pastsix elizabeth was summoned to dinner. to the civil inquirieswhich then poured in, and amongst which she had the pleasureof distinguishing the much superior solicitude of mr. bingley's,she could not make a very favourable answer. jane was by nomeans better. the sisters, on hearing this, repeated three or fourtimes how much they were grieved, how shocking it was to havea bad cold, and how excessively they disliked being illthemselves; and then thought no more of the matter: and theirindifference towards jane when not immediately before themrestored elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her former dislike.their brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom shecould regard with any complacency. his anxiety for jane wasevident, and his attentions to herself most pleasing, andthey prevented her feeling herself so much an intruder as shebelieved she was considered by the others. she had very littlenotice from any but him. miss bingley was engrossed by mr.darcy, her sister scarcely less so; and as for mr. hurst, bywhom elizabeth sat, he was an indolent man, who lived only toeat, drink, and play at cards; who, when he found her to prefera plain dish to a ragout, had nothing to say to her.when dinner was over, she returned directly to jane, and missbingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room.her manners were pronounced to be very bad indeed, a mixtureof pride and impertinence; she had no conversation, no style, nobeauty. mrs. hurst thought the same, and added:"she has nothing, in short, to recommend her, but being anexcellent walker. i shall never forget her appearance thismorning. she really looked almost wild.""she did, indeed, louisa. i could hardly keep my countenance.very nonsensical to come at all! why must she be scamperingabout the country, because her sister had a cold? her hair, sountidy, so blowsy!""yes, and her petticoat; i hope you saw her petticoat, six inchesdeep in mud, i am absolutely certain; and the gown which hadbeen let down to hide it not doing its office.""your picture may be very exact, louisa," said bingley; "butthis was all lost upon me. i thought miss elizabeth bennetlooked remarkably well when she came into the room thismorning. her dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice.""you observed it, mr. darcy, i am sure," said miss bingley;"and i am inclined to think that you would not wish to seeyour sister make such an exhibition.""certainly not.""to walk three miles, or four miles, or five miles, or whatever itis, above her ankles in dirt, and alone, quite alone! what couldshe mean by it? it seems to me to show an abominable sort ofconceited independence, a most country-town indifference todecorum.""it shows an affection for her sister that is very pleasing," saidbingley."i am afraid, mr. darcy," observed miss bingley in a halfwhisper, "that this adventure has rather affected youradmiration of her fine eyes.""not at all," he replied; "they were brightened by the exercise."a short pause followed this speech, and mrs. hurst began again:"i have a excessive regard for miss jane bennet, she is reallya very sweet girl, and i wish with all my heart she were wellsettled. but with such a father and mother, and such lowconnections, i am afraid there is no chance of it.""i think i have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney onmeryton.""yes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near cheapside.""that is capital," added her sister, and they both laughed heartily."if they had uncles enough to fill all cheapside," criedbingley, "it would not make them one jot less agreeable.""but it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying menof any consideration in the world," replied darcy.to this speech bingley made no answer; but his sisters gave ittheir hearty assent, and indulged their mirth for some time at theexpense of their dear friend's vulgar relations.with a renewal of tenderness, however, they returned to herroom on leaving the dining-parlour, and sat with her tillsummoned to coffee. she was still very poorly, and elizabethwould not quit her at all, till late in the evening, when she hadthe comfort of seeing her sleep, and when it seemed to her ratherright than pleasant that she should go downstairs herself. onentering the drawing-room she found the whole party at loo, andwas immediately invited to join them; but suspecting them to beplaying high she declined it, and making her sister the excuse,said she would amuse herself for the short time she could staybelow, with a book. mr. hurst looked at her with astonishment."do you prefer reading to cards?" said he; "that is rathersingular.""miss eliza bennet," said miss bingley, "despises cards. she isa great reader, and has no pleasure in anything else.""i deserve neither such praise nor such censure," cried elizabeth;"i am not a great reader, and i have pleasure in many things.""in nursing your sister i am sure you have pleasure," said bingley;"and i hope it will be soon increased by seeing her quite well."elizabeth thanked him from her heart, and then walked towardsthe table where a few books were lying. he immediately offeredto fetch her others--all that his library afforded."and i wish my collection were larger for your benefit and myown credit; but i am an idle fellow, and though i have not many,i have more than i ever looked into."elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly withthose in the room."i am astonished," said miss bingley, "that my father shouldhave left so small a collection of books. what a delightful libraryyou have at pemberley, mr. darcy!""it ought to be good," he replied, "it has been the work of manygenerations.""and then you have added so much to it yourself, you arealways buying books.""i cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such daysas these.""neglect! i am sure you neglect nothing that can add to thebeauties of that noble place. charles, when you build yourhouse, i wish it may be half as delightful as pemberley.""i wish it may.""but i would really advise you to make your purchase in thatneighbourhood, and take pemberley for a kind of model. thereis not a finer county in england than derbyshire.""with all my heart; i will buy pemberley itself if darcy willsell it.""i am talking of possibilities, charles.""upon my word, caroline, i should think it more possible to getpemberley by purchase than by imitation."elizabeth was so much caught with what passed, as to leave hervery little attention for her book; and soon laying it whollyaside, she drew near the card-table, and stationed herselfbetween mr. bingley and his eldest sister, to observe the game."is miss darcy much grown since the spring?" said missbingley; "will she be as tall as i am?""i think she will. she is now about miss elizabeth bennet'sheight, or rather taller.""how i long to see her again! i never met with anybody whodelighted me so much. such a countenance, such manners! andso extremely accomplished for her age! her performance on thepianoforte is exquisite.""it is amazing to me," said bingley, "how young ladies can havepatience to be so very accomplished as they all are.""all young ladies accomplished! my dear charles, what do you mean?""yes, all of them, i think. they all paint tables, cover screens,and net purses. i scarcely know anyone who cannot do all this,and i am sure i never heard a young lady spoken of for the firsttime, without being informed that she was very accomplished.""your list of the common extent of accomplishments," said darcy,"has too much truth. the word is applied to many a woman whodeserves it no otherwise than by netting a purse or coveringa screen. but i am very far from agreeing with you in yourestimation of ladies in general. i cannot boast of knowingmore than half-a-dozen, in the whole range of my acquaintance,that are really accomplished.""nor i, i am sure," said miss bingley."then," observed elizabeth, "you must comprehend a great dealin your idea of an accomplished woman.""yes, i do comprehend a great deal in it.""oh! certainly," cried his faithful assistant, "no one can be reallyesteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what isusually met with. a woman must have a thorough knowledge ofmusic, singing, drawing, dancing, and the modern languages, todeserve the word; and besides all this, she must possess a certainsomething in her air and manner of walking, the tone of hervoice, her address and expressions, or the word will be buthalf-deserved.""all this she must possess," added darcy, "and to all this shemust yet add something more substantial, in the improvement ofher mind by extensive reading.""i am no longer surprised at your knowing only six accomplishedwomen. i rather wonder now at your knowing any.""are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibilityof all this?""i never saw such a woman. i never saw such capacity, andtaste, and application, and elegance, as you describe united."mrs. hurst and miss bingley both cried out against the injusticeof her implied doubt, and were both protesting that they knewmany women who answered this description, when mr. hurstcalled them to order, with bitter complaints of their inattentionto what was going forward. as all conversation was thereby atan end, elizabeth soon afterwards left the room."elizabeth bennet," said miss bingley, when the door wasclosed on her, "is one of those young ladies who seek torecommend themselves to the other sex by undervaluing theirown; and with many men, i dare say, it succeeds. but, in myopinion, it is a paltry device, a very mean art.""undoubtedly," replied darcy, to whom this remark was chieflyaddressed, "there is a meanness in all the arts which ladiessometimes condescend to employ for captivation. whateverbears affinity to cunning is despicable."miss bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as tocontinue the subject.elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse,and that she could not leave her. bingley urged mr. jones beingsent for immediately; while his sisters, convinced that no countryadvice could be of any service, recommended an express to town forone of the most eminent physicians. this she would not hear of;but she was not so unwilling to comply with their brother'sproposal; and it was settled that mr. jones should be sent forearly in the morning, if miss bennet were not decidedly better.bingley was quite uncomfortable; his sisters declared that theywere miserable. they solaced their wretchedness, however, byduets after supper, while he could find no better relief to hisfeelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that everyattention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister.chapter 9elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister's room, andin the morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerableanswer to the inquiries which she very early received from mr.bingley by a housemaid, and some time afterwards from the twoelegant ladies who waited on his sisters. in spite of thisamendment, however, she requested to have a note sent to longbourn,desiring her mother to visit jane, and form her own judgement ofher situation. the note was immediately dispatched, and itscontents as quickly complied with. mrs. bennet, accompanied byher two youngest girls, reached netherfield soon after the familybreakfast.had she found jane in any apparent danger, mrs. bennet wouldhave been very miserable; but being satisfied on seeing her thather illness was not alarming, she had no wish of her recoveringimmediately, as her restoration to health would probably removeher from netherfield. she would not listen, therefore, to herdaughter's proposal of being carried home; neither did theapothecary, who arrived about the same time, think it at alladvisable. after sitting a little while with jane, on missbingley's appearance and invitation, the mother and threedaughter all attended her into the breakfast parlour. bingley metthem with hopes that mrs. bennet had not found miss bennetworse than she expected."indeed i have, sir," was her answer. "she is a great deal tooill to be moved. mr. jones says we must not think of moving her.we must trespass a little longer on your kindness.""removed!" cried bingley. "it must not be thought of. mysister, i am sure, will not hear of her removal.""you may depend upon it, madam," said miss bingley, with coldcivility, "that miss bennet will receive every possible attentionwhile she remains with us."mrs. bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments."i am sure," she added, "if it was not for such good friends i donot know what would become of her, for she is very ill indeed,and suffers a vast deal, though with the greatest patience in theworld, which is always the way with her, for she has, withoutexception, the sweetest temper i have ever met with. i often tellmy other girls they are nothing to her. you have a sweet roomhere, mr. bingley, and a charming prospect over the gravel walk.i do not know a place in the country that is equal to netherfield.you will not think of quitting it in a hurry, i hope, though youhave but a short lease.""whatever i do is done in a hurry," replied he; "and therefore if ishould resolve to quit netherfield, i should probably be off infive minutes. at present, however, i consider myself as quitefixed here.""that is exactly what i should have supposed of you," saidelizabeth."you begin to comprehend me, do you?" cried he, turningtowards her."oh! yes--i understand you perfectly.""i wish i might take this for a compliment; but to be so easilyseen through i am afraid is pitiful.""that is as it happens. it does not follow that a deep, intricatecharacter is more or less estimable than such a one as yours.""lizzy," cried her mother, "remember where you are, and do notrun on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home.""i did not know before," continued bingley immediately, "thatyour were a studier of character. it must be an amusing study.""yes, but intricate characters are the most amusing. theyhave at least that advantage.""the country," said darcy, "can in general supply but a fewsubjects for such a study. in a country neighbourhood you movein a very confined and unvarying society.""but people themselves alter so much, that there is somethingnew to be observed in them for ever.""yes, indeed," cried mrs. bennet, offended by his manner ofmentioning a country neighbourhood. "i assure you there isquite as much of that going on in the country as in town."everybody was surprised, and darcy, after looking at her for amoment, turned silently away. mrs. bennet, who fancied shehad gained a complete victory over him, continued her triumph."i cannot see that london has any great advantage over thecountry, for my part, except the shops and public places. thecountry is a vast deal pleasanter, is it not, mr. bingley?""when i am in the country," he replied, "i never wish to leave it;and when i am in town it is pretty much the same. they haveeach their advantages, and i can be equally happy in either.""aye--that is because you have the right disposition. but thatgentleman," looking at darcy, "seemed to think the country wasnothing at all.""indeed, mamma, you are mistaken," said elizabeth, blushing forher mother. "you quite mistook mr. darcy. he only meant thatthere was not such a variety of people to be met with in thecountry as in the town, which you must acknowledge to betrue.""certainly, my dear, nobody said there were; but as to notmeeting with many people in this neighbourhood, i believethere are few neighbourhoods larger. i know we dine withfour-and-twenty families."nothing but concern for elizabeth could enable bingley to keephis countenance. his sister was less delicate, and directed hereyes towards mr. darcy with a very expressive smile. elizabeth,for the sake of saying something that might turn her mother'sthoughts, now asked her if charlotte lucas had been atlongbourn since her coming away."yes, she called yesterday with her father. what an agreeableman sir william is, mr. bingley, is not he? so much the man offashion! so genteel and easy! he had always something to sayto everybody. that is my idea of good breeding; and thosepersons who fancy themselves very important, and never opentheir mouths, quite mistake the matter.""did charlotte dine with you?""no, she would go home. i fancy she was wanted about themince-pies. for my part, mr. bingley, i always keep servantsthat can do their own work; my daughters are brought up verydifferently. but everybody is to judge for themselves, and thelucases are a very good sort of girls, i assure you. it is a pitythey are not handsome! not that i think charlotte so veryplain--but then she is our particular friend.""she seems a very pleasant young woman.""oh! dear, yes; but you must own she is very plain. lady lucasherself has often said so, and envied me jane's beauty. i do notlike to boast of my own child, but to be sure, jane--one doesnot often see anybody better looking. it is what everybody says.i do not trust my own partiality. when she was only fifteen,there was a man at my brother gardiner's in town so much inlove with her that my sister-in-law was sure he would make heran offer before we came away. but, however, he did not.perhaps he thought her too young. however, he wrote someverses on her, and very pretty they were.""and so ended his affection," said elizabeth impatiently. "therehas been many a one, i fancy, overcome in the same way. iwonder who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in drivingaway love!""i have been used to consider poetry as the food of love," saiddarcy."of a fine, stout, healthy love it may. everything nourisheswhat is strong already. but if it be only a slight, thin sort ofinclination, i am convinced that one good sonnet will starve itentirely away."darcy only smiled; and the general pause which ensued madeelizabeth tremble lest her mother should be exposing herselfagain. she longed to speak, but could think of nothing to say;and after a short silence mrs. bennet began repeating her thanksto mr. bingley for his kindness to jane, with an apology fortroubling him also with lizzy. mr. bingley was unaffectedlycivil in his answer, and forced his younger sister to be civilalso, and say what the occasion required. she performed herpart indeed without much graciousness, but mrs. bennet wassatisfied, and soon afterwards ordered her carriage. upon thissignal, the youngest of her daughters put herself forward. thetwo girls had been whispering to each other during the wholevisit, and the result of it was, that the youngest should taxmr. bingley with having promised on his first coming into thecountry to give a ball at netherfield.lydia was a stout, well-grown girl of fifteen, with a finecomplexion and good-humoured countenance; a favourite with hermother, whose affection had brought her into public at an earlyage. she had high animal spirits, and a sort of naturalself-consequence, which the attention of the officers, to whomher uncle's good dinners, and her own easy manners recommendedher, had increased into assurance. she was very equal,therefore, to address mr. bingley on the subject of the ball, andabruptly reminded him of his promise; adding, that it would bethe most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it. hisanswer to this sudden attack was delightful to their mother's ear:"i am perfectly ready, i assure you, to keep my engagement; andwhen your sister is recovered, you shall, if you please, name thevery day of the ball. but you would not wish to be dancingwhen she is ill."lydia declared herself satisfied. "oh! yes--it would be muchbetter to wait till jane was well, and by that time most likelycaptain carter would be at meryton again. and when you havegiven your ball," she added, "i shall insist on their giving onealso. i shall tell colonel forster it will be quite a shame if hedoes not."mrs. bennet and her daughters then departed, and elizabethreturned instantly to jane, leaving her own and her relations'behaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and mr. darcy; thelatter of whom, however, could not be prevailed on to join intheir censure of her, in spite of all miss bingley's witticisms onfine eyes.chapter 10the day passed much as the day before had done. mrs. hurstand miss bingley had spent some hours of the morning with theinvalid, who continued, though slowly, to mend; and in theevening elizabeth joined their party in the drawing-room. theloo-table, however, did not appear. mr. darcy was writing, andmiss bingley, seated near him, was watching the progress of hisletter and repeatedly calling off his attention by messages tohis sister. mr. hurst and mr. bingley were at piquet, and mrs.hurst was observing their game.elizabeth took up some needlework, and was sufficientlyamused in attending to what passed between darcy and hiscompanion. the perpetual commendations of the lady, either onhis handwriting, or on the evenness of his lines, or on the lengthof his letter, with the perfect unconcern with which her praiseswere received, formed a curious dialogue, and was exactly inunion with her opinion of each."how delighted miss darcy will be to receive such a letter!"he made no answer."you write uncommonly fast.""you are mistaken. i write rather slowly.""how many letters you must have occasion to write in thecourse of a year! letters of business, too! how odious i shouldthink them!""it is fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot instead of yours.""pray tell your sister that i long to see her.""i have already told her so once, by your desire.""i am afraid you do not like your pen. let me mend it for you.i mend pens remarkably well.""thank you--but i always mend my own.""how can you contrive to write so even?"he was silent."tell your sister i am delighted to hear of her improvement onthe harp; and pray let her know that i am quite in raptures withher beautiful little design for a table, and i think it infinitelysuperior to miss grantley's.""will you give me leave to defer your raptures till i write again?at present i have not room to do them justice.""oh! it is of no consequence. i shall see her in january. but doyou always write such charming long letters to her, mr. darcy?""they are generally long; but whether always charming it is notfor me to determine.""it is a rule with me, that a person who can write a long letterwith ease, cannot write ill.""that will not do for a compliment to darcy, caroline," criedher brother, "because he does not write with ease. he studiestoo much for words of four syllables. do not you, darcy?""my style of writing is very different from yours.""oh!" cried miss bingley, "charles writes in the most carelessway imaginable. he leaves out half his words, and blots therest.""my ideas flow so rapidly that i have not time to expressthem--by which means my letters sometimes convey no ideasat all to my correspondents.""your humility, mr. bingley," said elizabeth, "must disarmreproof.""nothing is more deceitful," said darcy, "than the appearance ofhumility. it is often only carelessness of opinion, and sometimesan indirect boast.""and which of the two do you call my little recent piece ofmodesty?""the indirect boast; for you are really proud of your defects inwriting, because you consider them as proceeding from arapidity of thought and carelessness of execution, which, if notestimable, you think at least highly interesting. the power ofdoing anything with quickness is always prized much by thepossessor, and often without any attention to the imperfection ofthe performance. when you told mrs. bennet this morning thatif you ever resolved upon quitting netherfield you should begone in five minutes, you meant it to be a sort of panegyric, ofcompliment to yourself--and yet what is there so very laudablein a precipitance which must leave very necessary businessundone, and can be of no real advantage to yourself or anyoneelse?""nay," cried bingley, "this is too much, to remember at night allthe foolish things that were said in the morning. and yet, uponmy honour, i believe what i said of myself to be true, and ibelieve it at this moment. at least, therefore, i did not assumethe character of needless precipitance merely to show off beforethe ladies.""i dare say you believed it; but i am by no means convinced thatyou would be gone with such celerity. your conduct would bequite as dependent on chance as that of any man i know; and if,as you were mounting your horse, a friend were to say, 'bingley,you had better stay till next week,' you would probably do it,you would probably not go--and at another word, might stay amonth.""you have only proved by this," cried elizabeth, "that mr.bingley did not do justice to his own disposition. you haveshown him off now much more than he did himself.""i am exceedingly gratified," said bingley, "by your convertingwhat my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of mytemper. but i am afraid you are giving it a turn which thatgentleman did by no means intend; for he would certainly thinkbetter of me, if under such a circumstance i were to give a flatdenial, and ride off as fast as i could.""would mr. darcy then consider the rashness of your originalintentions as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it?""upon my word, i cannot exactly explain the matter; darcy mustspeak for himself.""you expect me to account for opinions which you choose tocall mine, but which i have never acknowledged. allowing thecase, however, to stand according to your representation, youmust remember, miss bennet, that the friend who is supposed todesire his return to the house, and the delay of his plan, hasmerely desired it, asked it without offering one argument infavour of its propriety.""to yield readily--easily--to the persuasion of a friend isno merit with you.""to yield without conviction is no compliment to the understandingof either.""you appear to me, mr. darcy, to allow nothing for theinfluence of friendship and affection. a regard for the requesterwould often make one readily yield to a request, without waitingfor arguments to reason one into it. i am not particularlyspeaking of such a case as you have supposed about mr.bingley. we may as well wait, perhaps, till the circumstanceoccurs before we discuss the discretion of his behaviourthereupon. but in general and ordinary cases between friend andfriend, where one of them is desired by the other to change aresolution of no very great moment, should you think ill of thatperson for complying with the desire, without waiting to beargued into it?""will it not be advisable, before we proceed on this subject, toarrange with rather more precision the degree of importancewhich is to appertain to this request, as well as the degree ofintimacy subsisting between the parties?""by all means," cried bingley; "let us hear all the particulars,not forgetting their comparative height and size; for that willhave more weight in the argument, miss bennet, than you may beaware of. i assure you, that if darcy were not such a great tallfellow, in comparison with myself, i should not pay him half somuch deference. i declare i do not know a more awful objectthan darcy, on particular occasions, and in particular places; athis own house especially, and of a sunday evening, when he hasnothing to do."mr. darcy smiled; but elizabeth thought she could perceive thathe was rather offended, and therefore checked her laugh. missbingley warmly resented the indignity he had received, in anexpostulation with her brother for talking such nonsense."i see your design, bingley," said his friend. "you dislike anargument, and want to silence this.""perhaps i do. arguments are too much like disputes. if you andmiss bennet will defer yours till i am out of the room, i shallbe very thankful; and then you may say whatever you like of me.""what you ask," said elizabeth, "is no sacrifice on my side; andmr. darcy had much better finish his letter."mr. darcy took her advice, and did finish his letter.when that business was over, he applied to miss bingley andelizabeth for an indulgence of some music. miss bingley movedwith some alacrity to the pianoforte; and, after a polite requestthat elizabeth would lead the way which the other as politelyand more earnestly negatived, she seated herself.mrs. hurst sang with her sister, and while they were thusemployed, elizabeth could not help observing, as she turnedover some music-books that lay on the instrument, how frequentlymr. darcy's eyes were fixed on her. she hardly knew how tosuppose that she could be an object of admiration to so great aman; and yet that he should look at her because he disliked her,was still more strange. she could only imagine, however, at lastthat she drew his notice because there was something more wrongand reprehensible, according to his ideas of right, than in anyother person present. the supposition did not pain her. sheliked him too little to care for his approbation.after playing some italian songs, miss bingley varied the charmby a lively scotch air; and soon afterwards mr. darcy, drawingnear elizabeth, said to her:"do not you feel a great inclination, miss bennet, to seize suchan opportunity of dancing a reel?"she smiled, but made no answer. he repeated the question, withsome surprise at her silence."oh!" said she, "i heard you before, but i could not immediatelydetermine what to say in reply. you wanted me, i know, to say'yes,' that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste;but i always delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes,and cheating a person of their premeditated contempt. i have,therefore, made up my mind to tell you, that i do not want todance a reel at all--and now despise me if you dare.""indeed i do not dare."elizabeth, having rather expected to affront him, was amazed athis gallantry; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archnessin her manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody;and darcy had never been so bewitched by any woman as hewas by her. he really believed, that were it not for theinferiority of her connections, he should be in some danger.miss bingley saw, or suspected enough to be jealous; and hergreat anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend jane receivedsome assistance from her desire of getting rid of elizabeth.she often tried to provoke darcy into disliking her guest, bytalking of their supposed marriage, and planning his happiness insuch an alliance."i hope," said she, as they were walking together in theshrubbery the next day, "you will give your mother-in-law a fewhints, when this desirable event takes place, as to the advantageof holding her tongue; and if you can compass it, do sure theyounger girls of running after officers. and, if i may mention sodelicate a subject, endeavour to check that little something,bordering on conceit and impertinence, which your ladypossesses.""have you anything else to propose for my domestic felicity?""oh! yes. do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt phillips beplaced in the gallery at pemberley. put them next to yourgreat-uncle the judge. they are in the same profession, youknow, only in different lines. as for your elizabeth's picture, youmust not have it taken, for what painter could do justice to thosebeautiful eyes?""it would not be easy, indeed, to catch their expression, but theircolour and shape, and the eyelashes, so remarkably fine, mightbe copied."at that moment they were met from another walk by mrs. hurstand elizabeth herself."i did not know that you intended to walk," said miss bingley,in some confusion, lest they had been overheard."you used us abominably ill," answered mrs. hurst, "runningaway without telling us that you were coming out."then taking the disengaged arm of mr. darcy, she left elizabethto walk by herself. the path just admitted three. mr. darcy felttheir rudeness, and immediately said:"this walk is not wide enough for our party. we had better gointo the avenue."but elizabeth, who had not the least inclination to remain withthem, laughingly answered:"no, no; stay where you are. you are charmingly grouped, andappear to uncommon advantage. the picturesque would bespoilt by admitting a fourth. good-bye."she then ran gaily off, rejoicing as she rambled about, in thehope of being at home again in a day or two. jane was alreadyso much recovered as to intend leaving her room for a couple ofhours that evening.chapter 11when the ladies removed after dinner, elizabeth ran up to hersister, and seeing her well guarded from cold, attended her intothe drawing-room, where she was welcomed by her two friendswith many professions of pleasure; and elizabeth had never seenthem so agreeable as they were during the hour which passedbefore the gentlemen appeared. their powers of conversationwere considerable. they could describe an entertainment withaccuracy, relate an anecdote with humour, and laugh at theiracquaintance with spirit.but when the gentlemen entered, jane was no longer the firstobject; miss bingley's eyes were instantly turned toward darcy,
