you don't know about me without you have read a book by the name of theadventures of tom sawyer; but that ain't no matter. that book was madeby mr. mark twain, and he told the truth, mainly. there was things whichhe stretched, but mainly he told the truth. that is nothing. i neverseen anybody but lied one time or another, without it was aunt polly, orthe widow, or maybe mary. aunt polly--tom's aunt polly, she is--andmary, and the widow douglas is all told about in that book, which ismostly a true book, with some stretchers, as i said before.now the way that the book winds up is this: tom and me found the moneythat the robbers hid in the cave, and it made us rich. we got sixthousand dollars apiece--all gold. it was an awful sight of money whenit was piled up. well, judge thatcher he took it and put it out atinterest, and it fetched us a dollar a day apiece all the year round--more than a body could tell what to do with. the widow douglas she tookme for her son, and allowed she would sivilize me; but it was roughliving in the house all the time, considering how dismal regular anddecent the widow was in all her ways; and so when i couldn't stand it nolonger i lit out. i got into my old rags and my sugar-hogshead again,and was free and satisfied. but tom sawyer he hunted me up and said hewas going to start a band of robbers, and i might join if i would go backto the widow and be respectable. so i went back.the widow she cried over me, and called me a poor lost lamb, and shecalled me a lot of other names, too, but she never meant no harm by it.she put me in them new clothes again, and i couldn't do nothing but sweatand sweat, and feel all cramped up. well, then, the old thing commencedagain. the widow rung a bell for supper, and you had to come to time.when you got to the table you couldn't go right to eating, but you had towait for the widow to tuck down her head and grumble a little over thevictuals, though there warn't really anything the matter with them,--thatis, nothing only everything was cooked by itself. in a barrel of oddsand ends it is different; things get mixed up, and the juice kind ofswaps around, and the things go better.after supper she got out her book and learned me about moses and thebulrushers, and i was in a sweat to find out all about him; but by and byshe let it out that moses had been dead a considerable long time; so theni didn't care no more about him, because i don't take no stock in deadpeople.pretty soon i wanted to smoke, and asked the widow to let me. but shewouldn't. she said it was a mean practice and wasn't clean, and i musttry to not do it any more. that is just the way with some people. theyget down on a thing when they don't know nothing about it. here she wasa-bothering about moses, which was no kin to her, and no use to anybody,being gone, you see, yet finding a power of fault with me for doing athing that had some good in it. and she took snuff, too; of course thatwas all right, because she done it herself.her sister, miss watson, a tolerable slim old maid, with goggles on, hadjust come to live with her, and took a set at me now with a spelling-book. she worked me middling hard for about an hour, and then the widowmade her ease up. i couldn't stood it much longer. then for an hour itwas deadly dull, and i was fidgety. miss watson would say, "don't putyour feet up there, huckleberry;" and "don't scrunch up like that,huckleberry--set up straight;" and pretty soon she would say, "don't gapand stretch like that, huckleberry--why don't you try to behave?" thenshe told me all about the bad place, and i said i wished i was there.she got mad then, but i didn't mean no harm. all i wanted was to gosomewheres; all i wanted was a change, i warn't particular. she said itwas wicked to say what i said; said she wouldn't say it for the wholeworld; she was going to live so as to go to the good place. well, icouldn't see no advantage in going where she was going, so i made up mymind i wouldn't try for it. but i never said so, because it would onlymake trouble, and wouldn't do no good.now she had got a start, and she went on and told me all about the goodplace. she said all a body would have to do there was to go around allday long with a harp and sing, forever and ever. so i didn't think muchof it. but i never said so. i asked her if she reckoned tom sawyer wouldgo there, and she said not by a considerable sight. i was glad aboutthat, because i wanted him and me to be together.miss watson she kept pecking at me, and it got tiresome and lonesome. byand by they fetched the niggers in and had prayers, and then everybodywas off to bed. i went up to my room with a piece of candle, and put iton the table. then i set down in a chair by the window and tried tothink of something cheerful, but it warn't no use. i felt so lonesome imost wished i was dead. the stars were shining, and the leaves rustledin the woods ever so mournful; and i heard an owl, away off, who-whooingabout somebody that was dead, and a whippowill and a dog crying aboutsomebody that was going to die; and the wind was trying to whispersomething to me, and i couldn't make out what it was, and so it made thecold shivers run over me. then away out in the woods i heard that kind ofa sound that a ghost makes when it wants to tell about something that'son its mind and can't make itself understood, and so can't rest easy inits grave, and has to go about that way every night grieving. i got sodown-hearted and scared i did wish i had some company. pretty soon aspider went crawling up my shoulder, and i flipped it off and it lit inthe candle; and before i could budge it was all shriveled up. i didn'tneed anybody to tell me that that was an awful bad sign and would fetchme some bad luck, so i was scared and most shook the clothes off of me.i got up and turned around in my tracks three times and crossed my breastevery time; and then i tied up a little lock of my hair with a thread tokeep witches away. but i hadn't no confidence. you do that when you'velost a horseshoe that you've found, instead of nailing it up over thedoor, but i hadn't ever heard anybody say it was any way to keep off badluck when you'd killed a spider.i set down again, a-shaking all over, and got out my pipe for a smoke;for the house was all as still as death now, and so the widow wouldn'tknow. well, after a long time i heard the clock away off in the town goboom--boom--boom--twelve licks; and all still again--stiller than ever.pretty soon i heard a twig snap down in the dark amongst the trees--something was a stirring. i set still and listened. directly i couldjust barely hear a "me-yow! me-yow!" down there. that was good! says i,"me-yow! me-yow!" as soft as i could, and then i put out the light andscrambled out of the window on to the shed. then i slipped down to theground and crawled in among the trees, and, sure enough, there was tomsawyer waiting for me.chapter ii.we went tiptoeing along a path amongst the trees back towards the end ofthe widow's garden, stooping down so as the branches wouldn't scrape ourheads. when we was passing by the kitchen i fell over a root and made anoise. we scrouched down and laid still. miss watson's big nigger,named jim, was setting in the kitchen door; we could see him prettyclear, because there was a light behind him. he got up and stretched hisneck out about a minute, listening. then he says:"who dah?"he listened some more; then he come tiptoeing down and stood rightbetween us; we could a touched him, nearly. well, likely it was minutesand minutes that there warn't a sound, and we all there so closetogether. there was a place on my ankle that got to itching, but idasn't scratch it; and then my ear begun to itch; and next my back, rightbetween my shoulders. seemed like i'd die if i couldn't scratch. well,i've noticed that thing plenty times since. if you are with the quality,or at a funeral, or trying to go to sleep when you ain't sleepy--if youare anywheres where it won't do for you to scratch, why you will itch allover in upwards of a thousand places. pretty soon jim says:"say, who is you? whar is you? dog my cats ef i didn' hear sumf'n.well, i know what i's gwyne to do: i's gwyne to set down here and listentell i hears it agin."so he set down on the ground betwixt me and tom. he leaned his back upagainst a tree, and stretched his legs out till one of them most touchedone of mine. my nose begun to itch. it itched till the tears come intomy eyes. but i dasn't scratch. then it begun to itch on the inside.next i got to itching underneath. i didn't know how i was going to setstill. this miserableness went on as much as six or seven minutes; but itseemed a sight longer than that. i was itching in eleven differentplaces now. i reckoned i couldn't stand it more'n a minute longer, but iset my teeth hard and got ready to try. just then jim begun to breatheheavy; next he begun to snore--and then i was pretty soon comfortableagain.tom he made a sign to me--kind of a little noise with his mouth--and wewent creeping away on our hands and knees. when we was ten foot off tomwhispered to me, and wanted to tie jim to the tree for fun. but i saidno; he might wake and make a disturbance, and then they'd find out iwarn't in. then tom said he hadn't got candles enough, and he would slipin the kitchen and get some more. i didn't want him to try. i said jimmight wake up and come. but tom wanted to resk it; so we slid in thereand got three candles, and tom laid five cents on the table for pay.then we got out, and i was in a sweat to get away; but nothing would dotom but he must crawl to where jim was, on his hands and knees, and playsomething on him. i waited, and it seemed a good while, everything wasso still and lonesome.as soon as tom was back we cut along the path, around the garden fence,and by and by fetched up on the steep top of the hill the other side ofthe house. tom said he slipped jim's hat off of his head and hung it ona limb right over him, and jim stirred a little, but he didn't wake.afterwards jim said the witches be witched him and put him in a trance,and rode him all over the state, and then set him under the trees again,and hung his hat on a limb to show who done it. and next time jim toldit he said they rode him down to new orleans; and, after that, every timehe told it he spread it more and more, till by and by he said they rodehim all over the world, and tired him most to death, and his back was allover saddle-boils. jim was monstrous proud about it, and he got so hewouldn't hardly notice the other niggers. niggers would come miles tohear jim tell about it, and he was more looked up to than any nigger inthat country. strange niggers would stand with their mouths open andlook him all over, same as if he was a wonder. niggers is always talkingabout witches in the dark by the kitchen fire; but whenever one wastalking and letting on to know all about such things, jim would happen inand say, "hm! what you know 'bout witches?" and that nigger was corkedup and had to take a back seat. jim always kept that five-center pieceround his neck with a string, and said it was a charm the devil give tohim with his own hands, and told him he could cure anybody with it andfetch witches whenever he wanted to just by saying something to it; buthe never told what it was he said to it. niggers would come from allaround there and give jim anything they had, just for a sight of thatfive-center piece; but they wouldn't touch it, because the devil had hadhis hands on it. jim was most ruined for a servant, because he got stuckup on account of having seen the devil and been rode by witches.well, when tom and me got to the edge of the hilltop we looked away downinto the village and could see three or four lights twinkling, wherethere was sick folks, maybe; and the stars over us was sparkling ever sofine; and down by the village was the river, a whole mile broad, andawful still and grand. we went down the hill and found jo harper and benrogers, and two or three more of the boys, hid in the old tanyard. so weunhitched a skiff and pulled down the river two mile and a half, to thebig scar on the hillside, and went ashore.we went to a clump of bushes, and tom made everybody swear to keep thesecret, and then showed them a hole in the hill, right in the thickestpart of the bushes. then we lit the candles, and crawled in on our handsand knees. we went about two hundred yards, and then the cave opened up.tom poked about amongst the passages, and pretty soon ducked under a wallwhere you wouldn't a noticed that there was a hole. we went along anarrow place and got into a kind of room, all damp and sweaty and cold,and there we stopped. tom says:"now, we'll start this band of robbers and call it tom sawyer's gang.everybody that wants to join has got to take an oath, and write his namein blood."everybody was willing. so tom got out a sheet of paper that he had wrotethe oath on, and read it. it swore every boy to stick to the band, andnever tell any of the secrets; and if anybody done anything to any boy inthe band, whichever boy was ordered to kill that person and his familymust do it, and he mustn't eat and he mustn't sleep till he had killedthem and hacked a cross in their breasts, which was the sign of the band.and nobody that didn't belong to the band could use that mark, and if hedid he must be sued; and if he done it again he must be killed. and ifanybody that belonged to the band told the secrets, he must have histhroat cut, and then have his carcass burnt up and the ashes scatteredall around, and his name blotted off of the list with blood and nevermentioned again by the gang, but have a curse put on it and be forgotforever.
